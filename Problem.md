# Valid Parentheses

Given a string `s` containing just the characters `{` , and `}` determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

* Open brackets must have a corresponding closed bracket.
* Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket.
* Brackets can nest (See Example 2.)

## Example 1

```
Input: s = "{}"
Output: true
```

## Example 2

```
Input: s = "{{}}"
Output: true
```

## Example 3

```
Input: s = "{{"
Output: false
```

# Next Steps

* Once you've solved for a string of characters only containing `{` , and `}`. Think back to our puzzle, how should we handle an input that contains other characters?
