# Validating configuration files

You've been given a task to try and make sure that the configuration for a piece of software is correct.

The configuration looks like this:

```
menuentry 'Ubuntuâ€™ {
    recordfail
    load_video
    gfxmode $linux_gfx_mode
    insmod gzio
    linux   /boot/vmlinuz-5.4.0-139-generic root=/dev/mapper/ubuntu--vg-root ro
    initrd  /boot/initrd.img-5.4.0-139-generic
}
```

The software is fragile, it doesn't like it when the curly braces (`{` and `}`) don't match up.


How might we go about validating that the configuration is correct?
